The Solution Document is the primary work product from the solutioning process. It contains information captured from discussions with the prospect, analysis of their need and our proposal to meet that need. You can see all the solution documents [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1epLtw3t2yezhjLOj-rwZERDs0q5Ymb5D). 

The Version (Revised January 2, 2025\)  
Header Link Changes: Added the Lightwave Alignment document and removed Configurator that is now internal to Delivery. 

The version (revised June 17, 2024):  
Added link to Project Estimation document in the header

The version (revised May 1, 2024):  
Added link to Deal Strategy document in the header

The version (revised Feb 1, 2024):  
Updated to reflect comments by Elisabeth Beller (deliverable language to be SOW ready, and adding any additional assumptions to SOW section)  
Updated to remind Solution Architects that whenever quoting resources from a specialty practice (for example, Data/Analytics for UX) we validate our estimates with them.  
Updated to include the solution context and solution architecture in the Approach (based on [Master 3Pillar Proposal Template 2024](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10WopfkbRAAMsl_WNWaZnpvlkR_pGr5hjB51NN3XZUrk/edit?usp=sharing) \- slides 28 \- 29\)  
Updated to remind Solution Architects to try to find out information on where the client is located, what are the business hours of our partners, etc (Section 2: Client Landscape / Client Context).

The version (revised Nov 16, 2023):

* New Configurator template  
* Updated the section: Letter to Product Lifecycle Manager and Sales team  
* Updated the section: Proposed Solution  
* Added Appendix B: Engagement Types

The version (revised August 8, 2023):

* Updated the Client Landscape section  
* Cleaned up section Solution Alternatives and   
  * Added Assumptions as table  
  * Added Risks as table  
  * Added Prerequisites subsection  
  * Added Constraints subsection  
* Added Solution Review Outcome section  
* Added subsection to Proposed Solution:  
  * Proposed Team Structure

Details

* There is the document structure: Client Landscape, Solution Alternatives, Solution Review Outcome, Proposed Solution, Finalized Input to the SOW, Letter to the Delivery Lead and Solutioning Retrospective.  
* Each section has an intended audience. For example the *Proposed Solution* is content specific for the proposal, stripped of any internal discussion that was apparent in earlier versions. You can read about what that audience is below and in the body of the document.  
* ●  	The *Client Landscape* section provides a high level picture of the client and its current state related to several aspects: executive team structure, involved personas, Lightwave Alignment sheet completed by Field CTO.  
* The *Solution Alternatives* section now usually contains more than one alternative. The alternatives contain internal-only information such as our ability to staff a particular solution and execution risk. Once the alternatives are prepared, we (Commercial, Solutions, Delivery, Teaming as needed) can choose one of them to present to the prospect.   
* The “*Solution Review Outcome*” section will contain details from the consensus meeting held together with Executive, Commercial and Product Delivery teams, after reviewing the “*Solution Alternatives*” section. Once the am alternative is selected, “*Proposed Solution*” section can be populated.  
* The *Proposed Solution* section contains client-facing language and pictures for the selected alternative. This will be prepared after the alternative is selected and is intended for direct inclusion in the proposal. Sometimes this will not be needed, but for complex proposals, what is in the alternative may not be translated into a specific structure for an email or deck proposal.  
* *Finalized Input to the SOW* represents any modifications to the solution required after it has been presented to the prospect. For example, they may increase the size of the team or mix of skills or initial scope to match their timeline or budget.   
* The *Letter to the Product Lifecycle Manager and Sales Team* is exactly that, and is intended to communicate the expectations that were set in the mind of the buyer during the sale that don’t make it into the SOW.   
* The final section \- *Solutioning Retrospective* \- provides an opportunity for the Solutions team to revisit a solution 30 \- 90 days into delivery and document how closely the delivery matches what was anticipated.

| :---- |

## **Customer Need**

## *What is the desired business outcome? What problem are they trying to solve? If possible, include both how they frame the problem and how we reframe it.*

Type here

**Assumptions and Risks**  
*Describe general assumptions and delivery risks that are apparent today.*

Type here

### **Assumptions**

*Attach in a table format a list of Assumptions made in deriving the solution alternatives.  Include assumptions made on the existing product and platform’s technical and functional capabilities.  Label them as dependencies if they are dependencies for the solution to succeed.*

| Assumption | Confidence in the Assumption (Low / Medium / High) | Adjustment needed if assumption is incorrect |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| *Working, scalable API that delivers xyz…* | *High confidence as it was demonstrated* | *Impact to delivery timeline* |
|  |  |  |

### **Risks**

*Attach in a table format a list of Risks and Risk Mitigation. Pay special attention to factors that can impede in the ability of teams to deliver successful results, e.g. Are there clear agreed upon artifacts that track scope and completion; is there lack of clear ownership; who owns definition of done; how is it created and measured; etc.*

| Risk | Level  (Low / Medium / High) | Risk Mitigation | Quantifiable Impact (e.g. cost increase, estimate increase, schedule impact) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| *Test QA strategy \- immature* |  | *Add QA person to address resources shortfall* | *Reaction time could impact the schedule.Additional resource could impact client’s budget* |

## **Prerequisites**

*Describe general artifacts (access, documents, diagrams, technical and architectural descriptions, personas, etc) that would later help and would be a must for a successful collaboration. Red Flags: Are there delays in obtaining these documents?  Are the artifacts old or inaccurate or missing?*

Type here

## **Constraints**

*Describe known constraints (security access, documents, product owners, working with other external resources, executive turnover, etc.) that would later be a blocker or would play a role in a successful collaboration.*

Type here

## **Approach \#1**

## *Describe the technical and resource approach to solving the problem. Discuss benefits to the customer in light of the aforementioned risks in the previous section. The approach should include an initial timeline. Please remember to include Product Delivery Leadership as part of the proposed solution.* 

*Describe how to measure success?  How does this tie back to the desired business outcome? Define major milestones as checkpoints to measure success. If applicable, describe the outcomes and artifacts that should be resulting from the effort.* 

*Include solution context and solution high level architecture, if applicable \- see [Master 3Pillar Proposal Template 2024](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10WopfkbRAAMsl_WNWaZnpvlkR_pGr5hjB51NN3XZUrk/edit?usp=sharing) \- slide 28 \- 29 \- references for Solution Context can be found here: [Architecture in the sales process](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Nts0IKNq8DbSkGUv1H3jExGgwRzsKZX83R15YOhkVkU/edit#slide=id.g15bb095902b_1_8)*

Type here

## **Alternate Approach (if applicable)**

## *This is a second solution which may differ from the first in scope, technical aspects or resourcing. Describe the technical and resource approach to solving the problem. Discuss benefits to the customer in light of the aforementioned risks in the previous section*

# **4\. Solution Review Outcome**

| Describe the outcome of the Solution Governance review and its impact on the solution. This is done before it goes to the Commercial Governance “Proposing” stage. |
| :---- |

Type here

# 

# **5\. Proposed Solution**

| This is the solution version that is actually presented to the customer in the proposal. As such the audience is exclusively the customer. This section may be only a time limited part of the overall preliminary solution, or it may reflect one or more of the alternatives. This section is drafted in conjunction with Commercial. It may be a simple ‘use Approach \#1,’ as above, or something more expansive.  |
| :---- |

## **Solution Summary**

| Offering type | *Choose one or more of Discovery, Growth and Scale, Design System, etc (https://sites.google.com/3pillarglobal.com/offerings/home)*  |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Engagement type** | *Choose one of these four: Co-build, Agile team, Short-term Consulting or Program (please refer to the Appendix B for Pre-requisites and Characteristics specific to each engagement type)* |
| **Technical Challenge** | *Describe in ten words or less the work being proposed. For example, ‘mobile app development’, ‘product management capacity building’, ‘qa automation’, ‘cloud migration’.*  |
| **Technical Environment** | *List the technologies in which our team should have a background (this may be more or less than the current client environment depending on the type of work)*  |
| **Team Size and Duration** | *Use this to give the reader a sense of how large the solution is*  |
| **Deliverable(s)** | *Summarize what is stated in the approach section as to content and timing of deliverables* |
| **Delivery Leadership Skill Set** | *Describe what is expected of the EPD/PDD/PDM, for example ‘heavy account management’, ‘part time PA’, ‘part time tech lead’, ‘experience with media customers’*  |

## 

## **Proposal**

## *Provide content specifically for the proposal for the selected alternative. This can be a link to the proposal deck itself,  content for the slides or references to standard content that is appropriate for this solution. If you make a reference to a standard proposal deck include the link here. If the proposal deck is based on an earlier proposal, identify the source opportunity.* 

Type here

## **Proposed Team Structure (from JPF in configurator)**

## *Describe Roles and Skills needed below. Please remember to include Product Delivery Leadership (Program Manager) as part of the team.  Also (**Important\!)** Please remember whenever quoting resources from a specialty practice (for example, Data/Analytics or UX \- either as a custom engagement or in the team construct from the offerings) we validate our estimates with them \- please reach out to the practice leaders or their designee for this.  The key is that we ensure that the proper skilled FTE % is aligned with our deliverables. Be particularly careful if resources are deviating from the scope of our standard offering.*

| Role / Tier- Level / Location | Practice / Skills Needed  | Proposed Start Date (if known) | Proposed End Date (if known) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| *Technical Architect …* |  |  |  |

# **6\. Finalized Input to SOW**

| This is the version of the solution that comes from discussions with the client after the proposal. This is the option that contains fully fleshed out staffing that the client has committed to and references the finalized TPF that will match the initial team. It is very important that we provide any additional assumptions we have to go along with the standard assumptions in the SOW.  Please take a look at the deliverables in section 5 if that language is not “SOW Ready” \- we need to add that language here for review and incorporation to the SOW by our legal team. This is the version of the solution that matches the SOW. It is *not* the SOW, just solution content crafted specifically for the SOW. This section is customer facing content based on the selected approach |
| :---- |

# **7\. Letter to the Product Lifecycle Manager and Sales Team**

| This section contains information to assist in the handoff to the Product Delivery Manager. It should include expectations set with the customer during the solutioning process that may not be otherwise written down. Also we are expanding this section to include a “Letter to Sales.” From a Solution Architecture perspective please list 2-3 points as to why 3Pillar is right choice for this work. If a Field CTO is involved in the opportunity, please list their 2-3 points as to why 3Pillar is the right choice  |

# **8\. Solutioning Retrospective**

| This section provides a post-award review of the solution document. After the delivery team has been working for some time (perhaps a few sprints), or after a short engagement is completed, a retrospective should be conducted to provide feedback to the solutioning team. |
| :---- |

Type here

# **Appendix A: Research (or Prep)**

| Develop a hypothesis based on initial information provided by the commercial team and through research into the customer, market and technical stack. The hypothesis provides context for the solutioning calls with the customer. Use this as a placeholder for collaboration with commercial team to populate with raw notes during client discovery calls, if necessary. |
| :---- |

This is not updated after the solutioning call (to allow process improvement)

## **Opportunity Context**

Client need, desired business outcomes, desired deliverables

## **Risks:**

Gaps in information?  Red Flags?  Will we have access to critical client-side contacts at beginning of engagement?

## **Research**

Pursuit plan, BuiltWith profile, tech stack

## **Hypothesis**

What the problem is and what 3P could do to help.

# **Appendix B: Engagement Types**

| Engagement Type | Prerequisites / Client Needs | Characteristics | Minimum |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
